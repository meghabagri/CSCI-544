# CSCI-544

## Programming Asssignments: 
- **Assignment-1** Implemented Naive Bayes Algorithm from scratch for spam mail classification.
- **Assignment-2** Implemented Hidden Markov Model from scratch for Parts-of-Speech Tagging.
- **Assignment-3** Implemented a BiLSTM model which achieved an accuracy of 86% for Ciphertext Classification. Implemented in PyTorch.
- **Assignment-4** Fine-tuned RoBERTa model for Natural Language Inferencing. Implemented in Tensorflow.

## Project:
**Extreme Multi-Label-Text-Classification**
Worked on this project as a part of this course. In this project we try to solve the problem of extreme-multi-label-text-classification, which is a multi-label text-classification problem wherein the number of labels scale upto-millions. We created our own dataset which used Tweets as text to be classified and hashtags as the lablset. We benchmarked this dataset against state-of-the-art model Guided Network by [Wang et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11582).
